# Bcrypt library 
    This library used and secure method for password hashing and verification, designed specifically to protect user credentials against brute-force attacks and credential stuffing.
    It is a wrapper around the OpenBSD bcrypt implementation, which uses an adaptive hashing algorithm that becomes slower as computational power increases, thereby increasing resistance to attacks.
